# Computational Intelligent for Game Class Project

This project is created by undergraduate students of computer engineering ITS and supervised by the post-graduate student of Game technology ITS. This project utilizes several crowd navigation methods such as RVO, PedVO, Social force, etc found in the crowd simulation framework from Atom Crowd and Golaem Crowd. Our objective is to study numerous crowd navigation AI when used simultaneously. We observe the crowds' agent interaction when facing other agents with dissimilar navigation manners. This project builds using Unreal Engine 4.27 with third-party plugins from Atom Crowds and Golaem Crowds.

We would like to thank Toolchefs LTD for granting us educational licenses for the Atom crowd.

We would like to thank Golaem S.A  for granting us an educational license for the Golaem crowd.
